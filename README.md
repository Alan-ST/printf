# _PRINTF

This project shows in a practical way the function _printf that prints
arguments as in any main function of the linux kernel.
All the functions and prototypes can be found in your holberton.h library.
The aim is to illustrate the code, and to make it very understandable, the way the arguments are printed in our _prinf function.
These instructions will allow you to get a copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
The best way to get this function is by cloning it from your pc or laptop with github.
git clone + _printf.
You just need to have a little space on your computer, a git hub account and that's it.
Once installed, you can do print tests as you would in a C programming language.

## How does it work?.
To make use of _printf () which works the same as printf () of the linux kernel
_printf at the moment follows the same syntax as print () and since it is in constant development, at the moment it only works with some arguments.

*% c = print a character
*% s = print a string
* %% = print a percent
*% d = print a integer
*% i = print a integer
